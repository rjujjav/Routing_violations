I have used the Tagets names as P1, P2, P3 and P4. These are named in accordance with the problem numbers in the HW sheet.

So the execution procedure for the 4 problems is:

problem 1: make p1

Problem 2: make p2

Problem 3: make p3

Problem 4: make p4


The first is pretty much as you asked. It simply executes the make from the pdrm directory. I have also verified that it creates those two files as mentioned. in  the rules for P1, you will see date entries, this is done to avoid doing the simulation again at P4

P2 does do the job as specified in P2, and the arguments are to be givent for the variable AUG. I have reffered certains websites for this and I am happy to share these references in a seperate medium if required.
P3 uses all the commands as specified in the order as shown in HW sheet.
P4 give the output of both time stamps and duration in seconds.
